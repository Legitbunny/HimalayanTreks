            <p class="secHeading">Best Himalayan treks in India !</p>
            <p class="text">
                Here are the best Himalayan treks to do this year. Although it was not easy to pick the best Himalayan treks as every trek is beautiful in its own way, we have put together the best Himalayan treks that we think you should not miss!
                <br><br>
                Beginner-friendly treks like Dayara Bugyal, Brahmatal and Kedarkantha are great to do all year round, except in monsoon.
                <br><br>
                In monsoon, between July and September, there are treks like Hampta Pass, Valley of Flowers, Kashmir Great Lakes and Tarsar Marsar.
                <br><br>
                Suppose you want to trek in the snow; target trekking between November and April. And, if you’d like to trek in spring, look out for treks in March and April, like Sandakphu Phalut, Khopra Ridge and Goechala.
                <br>
            </p>

                The highest point on this trek is the Brahmatal Top at 12,250 ft. It is a stunning trek. A new set of mountains open before you – Mt Chaukhamba, Mt Neelkanth, Mt Hathi Ghoda, Mt Trishul, and Mt Nanda Ghunti are by your side throughout the trek.
                <br><br>
                Brahmatal is an excellent trek to do solo as well. There is a lot of snow on the trail in December, January, and February. The trek runs until the end of April.

                Dayara Bugyal has all the elements of a perfect Himalayan trek — superb forests, beautiful campsites, ancient villages, thrilling climbs to high points, wonderful mountain views and a few of the best alpine meadows of Uttarakhand. These meadows are completely blanketed in snow in winter. This is an easy-moderate trek– a gift we rarely see.

                It is an extremely special trek because it is not just a section of the Himalayan ranges that you see, but all the major summits of Western and Eastern Uttarakhand from the summit.  
                <br><br>
                Not only that, but if you trek from March – April, you will also walk amongst the full-bloomed rhododendrons! And because of the different species of birds you see on the trail, it is rightly called a paradise for bird watchers.

                The Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara Tal trek brings out the perfect blend of culture and beauty in the Himalayas. Getting to experience the ancient Himalayan villages along with breathtakingly beautiful valleys, lakes and meadows is a very rare combination to come by.
                <br><br>
                Ruinsara Tal is located in complete isolation, and the Ruinsara valley is said to be prettier than the Har Ki Dun valley itself!

                The Phulara Ridge trek is great to do in September, October, November, May and June. It is a unique ridge trek in India, and one of the newer treks. The beautiful Pushtara meadows are another reason why every trekker must do this trek. 
                <br><br>
                Further, for a short duration of a trek, the Phulara Ridge trek has a beautiful dense forest section. If you are a wildlife, or bird lover, this is definitely the trek for you.

                The Sandakphu Phalut trek is one of the few treks from where you can see 4 out of 5 of the tallest mountains in the world — Mt Everest, Mt Lhotse, Mt Makalu and Mt Kanchenjunga. Amongst all Himalayan treks, this view is what the Sandakphu treks stands out for. Along with this, you also see the Kanchenjunga range with other Himalayan mountains, famously known as the Sleeping Buddha — an image that will stay with you for years to come.

                The Valley of Flowers trek is filled with legends. It is said the trekkers fall unconscious from the heavy scent of the flowers on the valley floor. The moment you enter the valley, you have a sweeping view of it’s vast expanse covered in a layer of flowers. Flowers, leaves, buds of various shapes, sizes, colours are seen here.
                <br><br>
                The trek also goes through the Hemkund Sahib, one of the highest places of pilgrimage and worship.

                You must do this trek because it is one of the most dramatic crossover treks in the country pass. It begins from the lush green valleys of Kullu through a narrow gorge-like valley to an overhang high in the mountains. From the pass, you can see the entire Spiti valley in one wide panoramic sweep.

                Kedartal is a difficult trek compared to other Himalayan treks. This trek is for experienced trekkers, and adventure lovers. The trek climbs to the glacial Kedartal lake, that is surrounded by big mountains. Some of the most famous mountains rise in front of you in this cauldron – Mt Thalaysagar, Mt Bhrigupanth, Mt Nanda Parvat, Mt Jogin, and Mt Gangotri.
                <br><br>
                This trek is extremely challenging with river crossings, spider wall, and the sheer altitude itself.

                The Bali Pass trek is a difficult Himalayan trek. This is partly due to the high altitude that rises to over 16,000 ft. The Bali Pass trek is more than an adventure filled trek, you also pass through some historical villages and trek to Ruinsara Tal – a stunning high altitude lake.
                <br><br>
                Another aspect  that stands out on the Bali Pass trek is the rocky approach to Bali Pass itself. In the month of June and July the higher regions of the pass are covered in snow! In monsoon it is a drier patch. If you enjoy high altitude pass traverses, this is the trek for you.

                <br><br>
                The trek has everything to offer - Varying colours, Pass crossings, River crosses, Glacial walks, Alpine lakes and beautiful villages.
                <br><br>
                However, this means that this trek is not meant for everyone. The trek is a difficult one. You need to be extremely fit with some prior high-altitude trek experience to get on this trail.
